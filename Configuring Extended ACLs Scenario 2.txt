Configuring Extended ACLs - Scenario 2 

Network Configuration
Complete physical configuration same as given in the figure
Configure router with 3 ip addresses
Configure 2 pcs
Switch Configuration


Switch 0 /Switch A
int     vlan1
no shut
(ip addr ipaddress netmask)
ip   addr   10.101.117.50    255.255.255.248 
no shut
(ip default-gateway ipaddressofgateway)
ip   default-gateway   10.101.117.49 

Similary do configuratio on Switch B and Switch C



Security Implementation
Add following rules in ACL
1. SSH traffic from devices on the 10.101.117.32/28  network is allowed to devices on the 10.101.117.0/27 networks. 
2. ICMP traffic is allowed from any source to any destination. 
3. All other traffic to 10.101.117.0/27 is blocked.


1. SSH traffic from devices on the 10.101.117.32/28 network is allowed to devices on the 10.101.117.0/27 networks. 

//First configure SSH on the switch C
//Give following commands on swich C

ip domain-name testsecurity.com
hostname testsecurity
Username SSHadmin privilege 15 secret passwd55
line vty 0 4
login local
transport input ssh  
crypto key generate rsa
//It will ask for number of bit for keys
//Enter 1024
//You will receive message of key generation
//Give following commands on router to create ACL

access-list 199 permit tcp   10.101.117.32   0.0.0.15   10.101.117.0  0.0.0.31   eq   22
access-list 199 permit icmp any any

//By default other traffic would be denied
//Apply the extended ACL
int gig0/2
ip access-group 199 out

//Testing
Ping from PC-B to Switch C : Successful
Ping from PC-A to Switch C : Successful

SSH from PC-B to Switch C : Successful
SSH from PC-A to Switch C : UnSuccessful
