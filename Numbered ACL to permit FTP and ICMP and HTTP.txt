Configuring Extended ACLs - Scenario 1 (Prac 3 in pdf)

// Configure, Apply and Verify an Extended Numbered ACL

// Configure an ACL to permit FTP and ICMP

/* Steps to follow while using ACL
1. To create ACL
2. To apply ACL on router's interface
3. To test working of ACL
*/

/* First create and configure network structure as given in the practical manual*/


//Following command will permit ftp traffic from PC1 to server
 access-list 100 permit tcp 172.22.34.64  0.0.0.31 host 172.22.34.62 eq ftp


//Following command will permit icmp traffic from PC1 to server
access-list 100 permit icmp 172.22.34.64 0.0.0.31  host 172.22.34.62


//Apply the ACL on the correct interface to filter traffic
//Give following command on gig0/0 of router which is connected to PC1

 interface gigabitEthernet 0/0 
 ip access-group 100 in


//Enabling ACL for incoming traffic on router1 gig0/0 interface
//Configure, Apply and Verify an Extended Named ACL 
//Configure an ACL to permit HTTP access and ICMP

 ip access-list extended HTTP_ONLY 
 permit tcp 172.22.34.96 0.0.0.15 host 172.22.34.62 eq www
 permit icmp 172.22.34.96 0.0.0.15 host 172.22.34.62

// Apply the ACL on the correct interface to filter traffic. 

 interface gigabitEthernet 0/1
 ip access-group HTTP_ONLY in


 Verify the ACL implementation.
a. Ping from PC2 to Server. The ping should be successful, if the ping is unsuccessful, verify the IP
addresses before continuing.
b. FTP from PC2 to Server. The connection should fail.
c. Open the web browser on PC2 and enter the IP address of Server as the URL. The connection should be
successful.
